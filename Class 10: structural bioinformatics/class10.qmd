# The PDB database

Here we examine the size and composition of the main database of biomolecular structures- the PDB

Get a CSV file from the PDP database and read it into the R.

```{r}
pdbstats <- read.csv("Data Export Summary.csv", row.names=1)
head(pdbstats)
```

> Q1: What percentage of structures in the PDB are solved by X-Ray and Electron Microscopy.

My pdbstats data frame has numbers with commas in them. This may cause us problems. Let's see:

```{r}
pdbstats$X.ray
```

```{r}
as.numeric(pdbstats$X.ray)

```

We found a function called 'gsub()' now we can figure out how it wokrs

```{r}
x <- "22,200"
as.numeric(gsub(",", "", x))
```

I can turn this snipet into a function that I can use for every column in this table

```{r}
commasum <- function(x) {
  sum(as.numeric(gsub(",","",x)))
}

commasum(pdbstats$X.ray)
```

Apply across all columns

```{r}
 totals <- apply(pdbstats, 2, commasum)
totals
```

```{r}
round(totals/totals["Total"]*100, 2)
```

> Q2: What proportion of structures in the PDB are protein?

```{r}
(215684/249751891 *100)
```

#2 Visualizing Protein Structure

We will learn the basics of Mol" (mol-star) homepage: https://molstar.org/viewer/

We will play with PDB code 1HSG

Figure 1. HIV-1 protease structure in complex with the small molecule indinavir.

##Back to R and working with PDB structures

Predict the dynamics (flexibility) of an important protein

```{r}
library(bio3d)

hiv <- read.pdb("1hsg")
hiv
```

```{r}
head(hiv$atom)
```

```{r}
pdbseq(hiv)
```

Here we will do a Normal Mode analysis to predict functional motions of a kinase protein

```{r}
adk <- read.pdb("6s36")
adk
```

```{r}
modes <- nma(adk)
plot(modes)
```

Make a "movie" called a trajectory of the predicted motions:

```{r}
mktrj(modes, file="adk_m7.pdb")
```

Then I can open this file in Mol\* ....
